## Hello! 👋

I'm Martina Dohnal, a data analyst with experience in finance, accounting and controlling. Currently, I am an Financial Controller of EU-funded projects responsible for the financial management of a portfolio of projects worth multiple meur.💰

Fascinated by the impact of data on business operations, I retrained as a data analyst 📊 and enjoyed every second of the path I chose. I hope to blend my newfound data analysis skills with existing business knowledge to bring unique insights into my future role. 

I currently work on my Data Visualization skills and have so much fun doing it.❤

I love learning new things, and I'm a very curious person; INTJ-T personality.

If you catch me outside of work, I'm a frequent traveller, and an avid reader! 📖 Love hiking and my pets 🐕🐈🦜.

Also, I'm passionate about digital marketing, especially SEO.🔎

I enjoy connecting with new people; give me a shout at 📧 dohnal.martina@gmail.com, on Twitter
